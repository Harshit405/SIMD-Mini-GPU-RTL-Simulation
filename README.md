# SIMD-Mini-GPU-RTL-Simulation
This project implements a GPU-inspired SIMD processing core using Verilog HDL. A single opcode controls multiple parallel processing elements to execute the same operation on different data simultaneously. RTL simulation in ModelSim verifies correct parallel execution through waveform analysis.
